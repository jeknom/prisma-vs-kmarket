# Prisma vs. K-Market

The application helps you find out which store is the better option for you.

## Getting started

This Storybook contains documentation for the core library of the application. You should look through these documents before creating any new components to see if the thing you need is already in the project. You should also check out the [Mantine docs](https://mantine.dev/getting-started/), as this app is built on top of it and in most cases it covers all the UI component needs.
